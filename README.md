# ðŸš— Vehicle Detection using YOLOv5

This project presents a real-time **Vehicle Detection System** built using the YOLOv5 object detection framework. The system is trained on a custom dataset of traffic images and aims to accurately detect and localize vehicles such as cars, bikes, buses, and trucks in diverse environments.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

Vehicle detection plays a crucial role in intelligent traffic systems, surveillance, autonomous driving, and parking management. Traditional detection algorithms often struggle with dynamic road conditions, variable lighting, and occlusions.

In this project, we fine-tuned the YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset tailored for traffic scenarios. By leveraging YOLOv5â€™s speed and accuracy, the model delivers real-time object detection performance with high precision and recall.
